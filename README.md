🚀 PhD Student | Stanford University
🔬 Researching AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics
🎓 Passionate about advancing AGI & AI Ethics

I'm a PhD candidate at Stanford University, where my research focuses on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and their applications in robotics and autonomous systems. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI algorithms and real-world deployment, with a special interest in AI safety, fairness, and ethical considerations.

💡 I love contributing to open-source projects, collaborating on innovative ideas, and building tools that push the boundaries of AI research. I’m always looking for new ways to make AI more interpretable, robust, and aligned with human values.
